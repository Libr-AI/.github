## How it began

AI brings benefits, it comes with limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucination, bias, toxicity, and so on. Xudong developed the first version of LibrAI in the middle of his journey as a PhD student in NLP, focusing on fairness. Yuxia and Haonan joined next, extended LibrAI in fact-checking, detection of harmful speech, and the misuse of AI-generated text in educational, academic, and journalism context. 

The team has committed to developing the most technological advanced and accessible tool to provide users with trustworthy responses, minimizing potential risks and harms in the AI era.
